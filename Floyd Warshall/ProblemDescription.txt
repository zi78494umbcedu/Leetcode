Problem statement
You have been given a directed weighted graph of ‘N’ vertices labeled from 1 to 'N' and ‘M’ edges. Each edge connecting two nodes 'u' and 'v' has a weight 'w' denoting the distance between them.

Your task is to find the length of the shortest path between the ‘src’ and ‘dest’ vertex given to you in the graph using Flloyd warshall’s algorithm. The graph may contain negatively weighted edges.

Example :


3 3 1 3
1 2 2
1 3 2
2 3 -1
In the above graph, the length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 3 is 1->2->3 with a cost of 2 - 1 = 1.
Note :

It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges. Also the graph does not contain negative weight cycles.
