You are given a weighted undirected graph having n vertices numbered from 1 to n and m edges describing there are edges between a to b with some weight, find the shortest path between the vertex 1 and the vertex n and if path does not exist then return a list consisting of only -1.

Note - 
1. If there exists a path, then return a list whose first element is the weight of the path.
2. If no path exists then return a list containing a single element -1.

Example:
Input:
n = 5, m= 6
edges = [[1,2,2], [2,5,5], [2,3,4], [1,4,1],[4,3,3],[3,5,1]]
Output:
5 1 4 3 5
Explaination:
Shortest path from 1 to n is by the path 1 4 3 5 whose weight is 5. 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function shortestPath() which takes n vertex and m edges and vector of edges having weight as inputs and returns the shortest path between vertex 1 to n.

Expected Time Complexity: O(m* log(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraint:
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= m <= 105
0<= a, b <= n
1 <= w <= 105
