Problem statement
Given an undirected graph of 'V' vertices and 'E' edges. Return true if the graph contains a cycle or not, else return false.



Note:

There are no self-loops(an edge connecting the vertex to itself) in the given graph.
Example:
Given N=3, M =2, and edges are (1, 2) and (2, 3), with nodes 1, 2, and 3.

We return false because the given graph does not have any cycle.
