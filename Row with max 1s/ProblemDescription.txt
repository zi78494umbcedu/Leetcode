Problem statement
You are given a 2D matrix 'ARR' (containing either ‘0’ or ‘1’) of size 'N' x 'M', where each row is in sorted order.
Find the 0-based index of the first row with the maximum number of 1's.

Note :
If two rows have the same number of 1’s, return the row with a lower index.
If no row exists where at-least one '1' is present, return -1.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3, 'M' = 3
'ARR' = 
[     [ 1,  1,  1 ],
      [ 0,  0,  1 ],
      [ 0,  0,  0 ]   ]
Output: 0
Explanation: The 0th row of the given matrix has the maximum number of ones.
