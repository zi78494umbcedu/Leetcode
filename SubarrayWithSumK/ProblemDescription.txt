Problem statement
You are given an array 'A' of size 'N' and an integer'K'’. You need to generate and return all subarrays of array ‘A’ whose sum = ‘K’.

Note: In the output, you will see the 2D array lexicographically sorted.
Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 6 ‘K’ = 3
‘A’ = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Subarrays whose sum = ‘3’ are:
[1, 2], [3], and [1, 1, 1]
