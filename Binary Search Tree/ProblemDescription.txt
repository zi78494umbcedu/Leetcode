Problem statement
You are given an array ‘order’ which represents the inorder traversal of a binary search tree.



Find out if this traversal is valid or not.



Note: All values in the BST must be unique.

For Example:

‘order’ = {1, 2, 3, 4,5} is a valid inorder traversal for the following binary search tree:
      4
     / \
    2   5
   / \
  1   3
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= ‘N’ <= 10^5
1 <= ‘order[i]’ <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
6
2 3 5 8 9 10
Sample Output 1:
true   
Explanation of sample output 1:
In this testcase, ‘order’ = {2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10} is a valid inorder traversal for the following binary search tree:

      8
    /   \
  3      9
 / \       \
2   5       10
Sample Input 2:
4
1 2 1 4
Sample Output 2:
false
