Problem statement
You are given a stream of 'n' non-negative integers as the input, and you have to group the stream of integers in the form of disjoint intervals.



Your task is to Implement the ‘DisjointIntervals’ class having the two functions:



1) The first function is ‘addInteger(int val)’, which takes an integer ‘val’ as an argument and adds it to the stream.

2) The second function is ‘getDisjointIntervals()’, which returns a summary of the integers in the stream currently as a list of disjoint intervals.


Example:

Input: 'n' = 5 , stream =  [
                  [1, 1],
                  [1, 3],
                  [2],
                  [1, 2],
                  [2],
                ]

Output: [
          [ [1, 1],  [3, 3] ],
          [ [1,3] ] 
        ]

Explanation: First of all, 1 is added to the stream, and the disjoint interval will be {1, 1}. When 3 will be added to the stream, then the disjoint intervals will be {1, 1}, {3, 3}. But when 2 is added to the stream then the disjoint interval will be {1, 3} as 2 lies between these two sets of disjoint intervals, and both the intervals {1, 1} and {3, 3} merge.

Explanation for sample Input 1:
First 3 is added to the stream, and the disjoint interval will be {3, 3}. When 6 will be added to the stream, then the disjoint intervals will be {3, 3},{6, 6}. But when 5 is added to the stream, then the disjoint interval will be {3, 3}, {5, 6} as 5 merges with the interval {6, 6} because the difference between interval {5, 5} and {6, 6} is less than 2.
Sample Input 2:

Sample Output 2:
1 1

1 1 3 4
Explanation for sample Input 1:
First, 1 is added to the stream, and the disjoint interval will be {1, 1}. When 4 will be added to the stream, then the disjoint intervals will be {1, 1},{4, 4}. But when 3 is added to the stream, then the disjoint interval will be {1, 1}, {3, 4} as 3 merges with the interval {4, 4}.
Constraints:
