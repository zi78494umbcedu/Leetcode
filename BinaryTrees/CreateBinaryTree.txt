Problem statement
Given an array 'arr' that contains 7 integers representing the values of nodes in a binary tree. This represents level order. The first element of the array represents the value of the root node.

Your objective is to construct a binary tree using the remaining 6 elements of the array, creating nodes for each of these values and return root node.

For example:
arr = [11, 22, 3, 54, 15, 23, 21]
The 7 node binary tree is represented below.
