Problem statement
Given an integer 'N', determine the maximum number of nodes present on 'Nth' level in a binary tree.



For Example:

N = 3
For level 1, we have 1 node.
For level 2, we have 2 nodes.
For level 3, we have 4 nodes
Output = 4, as level 3 has maximum 4 nodes.

Sample Input 1:
2
Sample Output 1:
2
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
N = 2
For level 1, we have 1 node.
For level 2, we have 2 nodes.
Output = 2, as level 2 has maximum 2 nodes.

Sample Input 2:
4
Sample Output 2:
8
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
N = 4
For level 1, we have 1 node.
For level 2, we have 2 nodes.
For level 3, we have 4 nodes
For level 4, we have 8 nodes
Output = 8, as level 4 has maximum 8 nodes.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 20
Time Limit: 1 sec
